The trail grades will help you understand what sort of hike you are looking at, providing the information necessary to choose the perfect tour. Keep in mind that the grades are a reference and somewhat subjective!

Montaraz Outdoors & Culture catalogs activities according to the necessary physical preparation and technical difficulty. Knowledge and handling of specific techniques and materials for guided activities are not required. If this is your first activity with Montaraz Outdoors & Culture and you have doubts about your level, we recommend that you contact us to help you make your choice.

The physical preparation is mainly based on the distance and accumulated positive ascent and is closely linked with the terrain of the trail.

The technical difficulty depends on the hiking trail type and its characteristics. The hiking trail types are:

- Hiking Trails are typically under 2.000m and are the easiest trail grade. The trails are usually better marked with smoother terrain levels for walking. The different surfaces have minor risks, small obstacles, and less steep sections.

- Mountain Hiking Trails are typically found between 2.000-3.000 m. The paths
are not always clearly marked with more difficult terrain to walk. The trails have bigger obstacles and can be exposed with ropes or chains to assist, boulder crossings in sections, more exposed areas, and steep sections.

- Alpine Trails are typically found above 3.000 m and are more challenging. The trails have unmarked sections and the terrain is mostly exposed - rocky slopes, delicate steps, or glacier passages.

#### C . Moderate

- Physical fitness: Good, with the habit of doing aerobic sports.

- Route distance of approximately 20 km.

- Accumulated positive ascent of the route: approximately 1.000 m.

- Duration trail: approximately 8 hours.

#### D . Challenging

- Physical fitness: Very good.

- Route distance of approximately 25 km or more

- Accumulated positive ascent of the route: approximately 1.500 m. or more

- Duration trail: more than 8 hours

#### E . Alpine Trail Challenging

- Physical fitness: Very good.

- Hiking at altitudes over 3.000 meters

- A doctor's release may be required for ascents up to 4.000 meters

## Techinal Difficulty

#### C .

- Previous mountain hiking experience: necessary.

- Trail type: Alpine Trail.

- Terrain: The trails are typically found above 3.000 m and are more challenging. The paths are not always clearly marked and the terrain is mostly exposed - rocky slopes with steep ascents/descents, delicate steps, or glacier passages.
