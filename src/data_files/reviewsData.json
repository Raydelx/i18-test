            "text": "This was my second cycling trip with Michael and Jose, alongside a group of 7 people, most of whom had joined a previous trip from Granada. We were picked up at the airport and taken to Ronda, where our 180-mile route began. The hotels were excellent, and Jose accompanied us in a van, providing water and snacks along the way, as well as organizing delicious lunches. The e-bikes were of high quality, making the steep hills easier to manage, and the scenery was beautiful. Michael also organized activities such as olive oil tastings and a guided tour in Córdoba. The experience was personalized and more affordable than other companies, and I will definitely be returning."

            "text": "Thank you for another fantastic trip! Having had an incredible cycling experience with Michael and Jose last year in the Sierra Nevada, my expectations for the Ronda to Cordoba trip were high, and they exceeded them once again. The route through beautiful countryside and charming villages was superb, with smooth Spanish roads. Even with e-bikes, we felt we earned the delicious lunches Jose prepared daily. The accommodations were comfortable, with plenty of pools for post-ride relaxation. This year’s olive oil tasting was a highlight, showcasing their attention to creating memorable experiences. They truly care about making our holiday the best, and I highly recommend them."

            "text": "I joined my friends on a cycling trip from Ronda to Cordoba (Sept/Oct 2024), opting for a road bike instead of an eBike to enjoy the challenge of the hills. Michael was incredibly helpful in sourcing the perfect road bike with the right specifications. The trip was a wonderful mix of charming white villages, olive groves, stunning views, delicious food, and comfortable hotels. Highlights included walking the breathtaking Caminito del Rey, a fascinating olive oil tasting, and visiting Cordoba’s incredible Mesquita. Throughout, Jose’s support vehicle and amazing lunches added to the experience, and Michael’s knowledge of the region enriched every moment. I’d love to book another trip with them—whether a tour or a hotel-based adventure. Thanks for the unforgettable memories, Michael and Jose!"
